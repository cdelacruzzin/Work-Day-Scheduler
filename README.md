# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
By noticing the challenges faced by busy people in today's faced-paced world, I was motivated to build this website. I noticed many people have a hard time keeping track of their tasks and effectively manage their time, which leads to disorganization and uncompleted tasks. I wanted to solve this issue by creating a website that allows the user to have control of their daily routines. I wanted to create a practical tool that would enable users to efficiently plan and schedule their tasks, allowing them to stay on top of their commitments and prioritize effectively. The website I developed aims to solve the problem of disorganization and inefficiency in task management. By providing users with a user-friendly platform, they can schedule their day according to their preferences and allocate specific tasks to each hour. There are visual cues, such as color-coding past, present, and future tasks. This provides a clear overview and enhance the overall organization of their day. Throughout the project, I learned valuable skills and technologies while reinforcing the significance of user-centric design and practical problem-solving.
